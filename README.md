# AIML-Projects

This is a collection of projects that I have completed throughout the Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning: Business Applications course at The University of Texas at Austin. This course covers many applied machine learning topics in python using a variety of datasets. The projects allow me to demonstrate my understanding of machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts while developing insights and recommendations for companies in simulated business scenarios.
